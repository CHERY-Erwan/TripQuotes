  - name: "Use type declarations extensively"
        description: "Add strict type declarations for all methods and properties"
        instructions: |
        - Always use typed properties: public string $name
        - Always specify return types: public function getName(): string
        - Use constructor property promotion when appropriate
        - Use readonly properties when possible
        - Use typed arrays with generics in docblocks: /** @var array<int, string> */
